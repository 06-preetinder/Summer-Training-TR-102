🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 17 of my summer training at AppTechies, and I began working on my first regression-based learning project. I used a housing dataset from Kaggle to try predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model.

Activities & Learnings:

Loaded and cleaned a real-world housing dataset

Performed EDA and feature preprocessing

Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn

Evaluated the model and calculated the accuracy, which came out to around 68%

Identified areas where the model could be improved (feature engineering, scaling, model selection)


📝 Reflection

Today’s hands-on experience showed me how theory translates into actual machine learning workflows. Although the model’s accuracy was modest, it highlighted the importance of better feature selection, outlier handling, and model tuning — skills I’ll aim to improve.

🔍 Next Steps

Try improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning and better data preprocessing

Explore other regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor)

Test the model on a different dataset to compare performance and generalization
