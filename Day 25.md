📅 Day 25 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: July 29, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 25, I dove deeper into Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and started learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Topics & Activities:

Implemented a basic ANN for classification tasks

Explored how ANN works under the hood – forward pass, backpropagation, and optimization

Got introduced to CNNs and understood their architecture:

Convolutional layers, ReLU activation, Pooling layers, and Fully connected layers


Discussed how CNNs are used for image classification and computer vision problems

Ran basic CNN examples using Keras/TensorFlow


📝 Reflection

ANNs gave me a solid foundation, and CNNs were a fascinating entry point into visual data analysis. The way CNNs extract spatial features and reduce parameters is impressive. The visual side of AI is exciting to explore.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice CNN projects with image datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)

Experiment with different architectures and parameters

Learn about overfitting and regularization in deep learning
