🧠 What I Did Today

Today marked Day 10 of my summer training at AppTechies. I spent the day reinforcing my Pandas skills by solving more practical questions and exploring how to manipulate and analyze real datasets.

I also got introduced to Matplotlib, which is the most widely used Python library for data visualization.

Topics Covered:

Solved questions on data filtering, grouping, and aggregation using Pandas

Practiced handling missing values and duplicate data

Learned the basics of Matplotlib:

Plotting simple line charts and bar charts

Understanding figure, axes, and labels

Basic customization of plots (titles, legends, colors)



📝 Reflection

Today’s practice with Pandas made my data handling skills more confident and practical. Starting with Matplotlib helped me see how data can be visualized to find patterns and insights — an essential step in any AI workflow.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice creating more plots using Matplotlib

Try combining Pandas and Matplotlib for data exploration

Learn about other types of plots (histograms, scatter plots) tomorrow
