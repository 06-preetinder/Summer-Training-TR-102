🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 4 of my training at AppTechies, I focused on two important intermediate-level Python concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Exception Handling.

Topics Covered:

OOP Basics: Understanding classes, objects, attributes, and methods

Special methods like _init() and __str_()

Concepts of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism

Creating simple class hierarchies and working with multiple objects

Exception Handling: Using try, except, else, and finally blocks

Raising custom exceptions using raise

Practical examples of handling runtime errors gracefully


📝 Reflection

Learning OOP strengthened my understanding of how real-world problems can be modeled in code. Exception handling showed me how to write more reliable and robust programs by anticipating and managing unexpected situations. Both topics are essential for building scalable AI applications.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice writing small OOP programs (classes, inheritance, method overriding)

Implement custom exceptions in small projects

Start exploring NumPy and basic data operations tomorrow
