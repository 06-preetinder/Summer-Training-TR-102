📅 Day 1 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: June 25, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

Today marked the beginning of my summer training journey at AppTechies, where I’ll be diving deep into Artificial Intelligence over the next few weeks. As it was the first day, I focused on setting the foundation by revisiting the core concepts of Python, which is essential for building AI systems.

Here's what I reviewed today:

Python Basics: Variables, data types, input/output, and indentation

Control Structures: If-else conditions, loops (for, while)

Functions: Definition, parameters, return statements, and scope

Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets – basic operations and usage

Object-Oriented Programming: Basic idea of classes, objects, _init_(), self, and methods

Modules & Libraries: Importing standard libraries and getting introduced to AI-specific ones like numpy and pandas


📝 Reflection

Although I’ve worked with Python before, this revision helped solidify my base. Python’s simplicity and readability make it ideal for AI development. I also realized how important it is to understand the logic behind each line, especially as I move toward complex AI workflows.

🔍 Next Steps

Set up my environment for AI development (Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, etc.)

Start exploring basic data manipulation using NumPy and Pandas

Begin studying foundational AI concepts (supervised vs. unsupervised learning)
