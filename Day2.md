üß† What I Did Today

On Day 2 of my summer training at AppTechies, I focused on strengthening my foundational programming skills by practicing Python problems involving basic logic building and string manipulation. These exercises helped enhance my problem-solving abilities and reinforced the importance of thinking algorithmically.

Additionally, I set up PyCharm as my primary development environment. Configuring it properly ensures I have a clean and efficient workspace for all upcoming AI projects.

Topics Practiced:

Logic-based coding challenges (patterns, number problems, etc.)

String functions and operations (len(), slicing, concatenation, lower(), upper(), find(), etc.)

Writing simple programs to implement conditional logic and string parsing


üìù Reflection

Today was a productive day as I transitioned from reviewing concepts to applying them. The problem-solving session helped me recognize areas that need more practice, especially in approaching problems methodically. Setting up PyCharm was a crucial step to streamline my development workflow moving forward.
