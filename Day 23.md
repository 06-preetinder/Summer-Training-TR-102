📅 Day 23 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: July 25, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 23, I worked on model validation and pruning techniques to improve Decision Tree performance.

Topics & Activities:

Studied and implemented Cross-Validation to evaluate model robustness

Applied Pre-Pruning techniques (like setting max depth, min samples split) to avoid overfitting

Practiced Post-Pruning to simplify an already trained decision tree

Compared performance with and without pruning


📝 Reflection

Cross-validation added reliability to my model evaluation, and pruning helped reduce overfitting while keeping accuracy stable. It’s fascinating how simple constraints can improve model generalization.
