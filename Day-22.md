🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 22, I explored important evaluation and optimization techniques in machine learning.

Topics & Activities:

Studied and implemented the Confusion Matrix to evaluate classification model performance

Learned about precision, recall, F1-score, and how to interpret them

Got introduced to GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Practiced these concepts using previously built models


📝 Reflection

Understanding how to evaluate model performance is just as crucial as building it. GridSearchCV helped me see how tuning the right parameters can significantly improve accuracy. Today’s work added an analytical layer to model training.

🔍 Next Steps

Implement Decision Tree with pre-pruning and post-pruning

Apply the full workflow to a small end-to-end project

Analyze and document model performance improvements after pruning and tuning
