🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 18 of my summer training, I focused on improving my regression model for the housing price prediction task.

Activities & Improvements:

Applied feature engineering to enhance input data quality

Used StandardScaler for feature scaling and normalization

Switched from Linear Regression to a more robust model: Random Forest Regressor

Observed improved performance, though still aiming for better accuracy


📝 Reflection

Experimenting with feature engineering and trying different models helped me understand how significantly preprocessing affects model performance. The switch to Random Forest showed noticeable improvement, confirming the importance of model selection.

🔍 Next Steps

Further tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest model

Try additional algorithms like Gradient Boosting

Visualize feature importance to gain deeper insights

Start preparing for classification models
