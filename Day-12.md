🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 12 of my summer training at AppTechies. I started learning Seaborn, a powerful Python library for advanced data visualization built on top of Matplotlib.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Seaborn and its advantages over Matplotlib

Explored different types of plots available in Seaborn

Learned about built-in datasets and how to load them

Understood how to create basic plots like countplot, barplot, and heatmap

Got familiar with Seaborn’s styling and themes for better-looking visualizations


📝 Reflection

Starting Seaborn showed me how easily complex visualizations can be created with less code and more beautiful output. I found its integration with Pandas very convenient for quick data exploration.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice Seaborn by solving questions and making various plots tomorrow

Learn to customize plots with palettes and annotations

Try comparing Matplotlib and Seaborn for the same datasets
