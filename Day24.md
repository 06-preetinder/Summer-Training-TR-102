📅 Day 24 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: July 28, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 24, I was introduced to the fundamentals of Neural Networks.

Topics & Activities:

Learned about the basic structure of a Neural Network:

Input layer, Hidden layers, and Output layer


Understood concepts like activation functions, weights, and biases

Explored how data flows through a network during forward and backward propagation

Looked into simple use-cases where neural networks can outperform traditional ML algorithms


📝 Reflection

Today was a foundational step into Deep Learning. Neural Networks are powerful and offer endless potential. I'm excited to explore how to train and optimize them effectively in the coming days.

🔍 Next Steps

Implement a simple neural network using Keras or TensorFlow

Study gradient descent and backpropagation in detail

Work on basic classification tasks using NN
