🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 15 of my summer training at AppTechies. I continued working on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and took a deeper dive into important data preprocessing techniques.

Topics Covered:

Studied different techniques for data normalization

Learned about get_dummies() for one-hot encoding categorical variables

Practiced Min-Max scaling to bring data within a defined range

Explored different methods for handling outliers in datasets

Understood how these preprocessing steps prepare data for machine learning models


📝 Reflection

Today’s deep dive into EDA and preprocessing showed me how crucial it is to transform raw data before feeding it to machine learning models. I realized how normalization and encoding directly affect model performance. Handling outliers also highlighted the importance of cleaning data thoroughly.

🔍 Next Steps

Start learning regression analysis using Scikit-learn (sklearn) tomorrow

Apply normalization and encoding techniques on datasets and fit simple regression models

Understand how to evaluate regression results and performance metrics
