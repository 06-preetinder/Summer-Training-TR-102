🧠 What I Did Today

Today, I built on my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by solving practical coding questions and implementing key OOP concepts.

Topics Practiced:

Data Abstraction: Creating abstract classes and methods to hide internal details and show only essential features.

Polymorphism: Method overriding and overloading examples to understand how the same function can behave differently.

Operator Overloading: Writing special methods to redefine how operators work with user-defined objects.


I wrote small programs to apply these concepts and tested how different OOP principles help in writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

📝 Reflection

Today’s hands-on practice gave me deeper insight into how powerful OOP is for real-world software and AI projects. Implementing abstraction and polymorphism made me realize how code can be kept flexible and easier to maintain.
