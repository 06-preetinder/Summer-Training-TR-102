🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 14 of my summer training at AppTechies. I started working on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to apply the skills I’ve built with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Topics Covered:

Began analyzing real-world datasets using EDA techniques

Explored data distributions, missing values, and outliers

Created various plots to understand data patterns and relationships

Practiced summarizing and interpreting key insights from data


📝 Reflection

Starting EDA helped me see how crucial it is to understand the data before building any AI models. Visualizing and exploring data made the hidden patterns more visible and highlighted which parts of the dataset need cleaning or special focus.

🔍 Next Steps

Continue EDA on more datasets over the next few days

Practice deeper feature analysis and correlations

Prepare cleaned datasets for future AI model building
