🧠 What I Did Today

Today marked Day 8 of my summer training at AppTechies. I wrapped up my basics of NumPy by practicing various questions to strengthen my understanding of arrays, indexing, slicing, and performing operations on numerical data.

With the NumPy foundation clear, I started exploring Pandas, which is another essential library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

Topics Covered:

Solved practical problems using NumPy arrays

Reviewed different NumPy functions for statistics and data processing

Installed and set up Pandas

Got an introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames and how they are used for handling structured data


📝 Reflection

Finishing NumPy practice has given me confidence to handle numerical data efficiently. The transition to Pandas feels natural as it builds on NumPy concepts and makes working with tabular data much more convenient. I’m excited to dive deeper into data manipulation and analysis in the coming days.
