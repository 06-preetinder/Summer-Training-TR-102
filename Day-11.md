🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 11 of my summer training at AppTechies. I focused on completing my learning of Matplotlib and practiced creating various plots to visualize and understand data better.

Topics Covered:

Completed basic and intermediate Matplotlib concepts

Created different types of plots: line plots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots

Learned to customize plots with titles, labels, legends, colors, and styles

Practiced plotting relationships between different columns in a dataset to find patterns and correlations


📝 Reflection

Wrapping up Matplotlib today gave me a clear idea of how visualization makes data more meaningful. Understanding relationships between columns through scatter plots and other visualizations will help me a lot when I move to real-world AI problems and data exploration tasks.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice combining Pandas and Matplotlib for deeper data analysis

Start with Seaborn for more advanced visualizations

Try building a mini data analysis project using the skills learned so far
