🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 6 of my summer training at AppTechies, I continued practicing Python OOP concepts and explored some more advanced topics related to class design and encapsulation.

Topics Covered:

Solved more OOP-based coding questions to strengthen problem-solving

Name Mangling: Learned how Python handles private variables using name mangling (__variable)

Access Specifiers: Understood the difference between public, protected (_variable), and private members

Practiced writing classes with proper encapsulation and data hiding


📝 Reflection

Today’s session helped me see how name mangling and access specifiers can be used to protect data and maintain class integrity. Practicing these ideas makes my understanding of OOP design principles stronger and more practical for future AI projects.

🔍 Next Steps

Keep solving problems that combine multiple OOP concepts

Start with NumPy and basic array operations tomorrow
