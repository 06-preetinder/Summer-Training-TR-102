📅 Day 3 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: June 27, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

Today’s focus was on diving deeper into Python’s built-in data structures. I explored how to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently using:

Tuple – immutable sequences

List – ordered, mutable sequences

Set – unordered collections of unique elements

Dictionary – key-value pairs for fast lookups


I also reinforced my understanding of looping constructs like for and while loops to iterate over these structures effectively.

Topics Studied:

Creating and modifying tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries

List methods like append(), extend(), pop(), remove()

Dictionary methods like get(), items(), keys(), values()

Using for loops to traverse each data structure

Understanding set operations like union, intersection, and difference


📝 Reflection

Today’s session strengthened my grip on essential Python structures that form the backbone of data processing in AI. Understanding the behavior and usage of these structures is key to writing clean and efficient code. I’m now ready to apply this knowledge to practical problem-solving.
