🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 7 of my summer training at AppTechies, I began working with NumPy, which is an essential library for numerical computing and data manipulation in Python.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to NumPy and its importance in AI and data science

Basics of creating NumPy arrays

Understanding array shapes, dimensions, and data types

Performing simple array operations and basic indexing


📝 Reflection

Getting started with NumPy showed me how powerful and efficient it is for handling large datasets and numerical operations. I found it interesting how NumPy arrays are faster and more flexible compared to Python’s built-in lists. This will definitely be helpful as I move towards more advanced AI tasks.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice more operations on NumPy arrays (slicing, reshaping, broadcasting)

Start with basic Pandas concepts for data analysis

Try combining OOP and NumPy in small examples
