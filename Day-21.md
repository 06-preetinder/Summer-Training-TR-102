📅 Day 21 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: July 23, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 21, we focused on learning and implementing the Decision Tree algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

Topics & Activities:

Understood how Decision Trees split data based on features using Gini Index and Entropy

Built and visualized a decision tree model

Learned about overfitting and how max depth/pruning can help prevent it

Compared performance with previous models like Logistic Regression


📝 Reflection

Decision Trees were easier to interpret and visualize compared to other models. It’s a great tool for understanding how features contribute to predictions. I also learned about the importance of tuning hyperparameters to avoid overfitting.

🔍 Next Steps

Study and implement Confusion Matrix to evaluate classification models

Use Decision Tree with real-world datasets and tune parameters for optimal performance

Explore Random Forest as a more robust ensemble method
