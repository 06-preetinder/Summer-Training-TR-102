🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 16 of my summer training at AppTechies. I started learning the basics of Linear Regression, one of the fundamental techniques in machine learning.

Topics Covered:

Understood the concept of Linear Regression and its use in predicting continuous outcomes

Learned about the relationship between independent and dependent variables

Explored the idea of the best-fit line and how it minimizes error

Looked at how Linear Regression works mathematically and conceptually

Prepared to implement Linear Regression using Scikit-learn


📝 Reflection

Understanding Linear Regression gave me my first glimpse into how machine learning models find patterns in data to make predictions. Learning how simple equations can model real-world relationships made the concept clear and interesting.

🔍 Next Steps

Implement a simple Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn tomorrow

Evaluate the model’s accuracy and visualize the regression line

Try practicing with different datasets to strengthen my understanding
