🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 20, I worked on one of the core classification algorithms — Logistic Regression.

Topics & Activities:

Understood the math and concept behind Logistic Regression

Applied it to a basic classification dataset

Learned how sigmoid function is used to map outputs

Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Gained clarity on binary classification tasks


📝 Reflection

Today gave me a solid understanding of how classification differs from regression. Logistic regression, despite its name, is actually quite powerful for classification problems and was a great entry point into this area.

🔍 Next Steps

Work on more classification problems using logistic regression

Explore other classification algorithms like KNN and Decision Trees

Improve evaluation skills by working with different metrics and ROC-AUC curves
