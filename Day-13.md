🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 13 of my summer training at AppTechies. I practiced Seaborn by solving various problem-based questions and created different types of visualizations to better understand how to represent data insights effectively.

Topics Covered:

Solved multiple questions using Seaborn for hands-on practice

Explored different plots like boxplot, violinplot, pairplot, and heatmap

Learned how to choose the right type of graph for different kinds of data

Understood how visualizations can help spot patterns and outliers


📝 Reflection

Practicing Seaborn plots today made me more comfortable with selecting and customizing graphs. This experience will be really helpful as I move to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the coming days to analyze datasets in depth.

🔍 Next Steps

Start performing EDA on real-world datasets

Combine Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to find insights

Practice cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting data trends
