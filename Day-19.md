📅 Day 19 – Summer Training at AppTechies

Date: July 21, 2025
Training Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Company: AppTechies

🧠 What I Did Today

On Day 19, we covered the basics of Machine Learning (ML) in a structured way to build a stronger foundation.

Topics Covered:

Overview of Machine Learning and its categories (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)

Concepts of features, labels, training and testing data

Understanding model evaluation metrics

Importance of data preprocessing, bias-variance tradeoff, and cross-validation

Real-world applications and scope of ML


📝 Reflection

It was great to revisit the fundamentals with more clarity now that I’ve already implemented a regression model. Today’s session gave me a clearer picture of how different ML components fit together.

🔍 Next Steps

Move toward classification problems

Start hands-on practice with algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, or Decision Trees

Work on datasets suited for classification tasks
