🧠 What I Did Today

Today was Day 9 of my summer training at AppTechies, and I focused completely on Pandas, which is one of the most important Python libraries for data analysis and manipulation.

Topics Covered:

Explored Pandas Series and DataFrames in depth

Learned how to create Series and DataFrames from different data sources

Practiced basic data operations like indexing, slicing, and filtering

Worked with built-in functions for describing and summarizing data

Did hands-on exercises to load, inspect, and clean simple datasets


📝 Reflection

Working with Pandas made me realize how powerful it is for handling real-world data. I enjoyed learning how to manage and analyze structured data efficiently — it’s clear why Pandas is such a core tool in the AI and data science workflow.

🔍 Next Steps

Practice more Pandas operations: merging, grouping, and aggregating

Try out simple data cleaning tasks with missing values and duplicates

Work with CSV files to simulate real-world data handling
